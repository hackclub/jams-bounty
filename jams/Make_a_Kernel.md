# Zig Kernel Jam: Building a Simple Kernel with Zig

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create a simple kernel using Zig programming language that displays a message in VGA text mode.

_Requirements:_ Zig 0.10.1, qemu emulator

_Language used:_ Zig

_Customization opportunity:_ Customize the message or modify the VGA text mode color scheme to create a unique visual style for the kernel.

_Platform Limitations:_ The project can be completed on platforms that support Zig programming language.

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour

### Breakdown:
1. Introduction: Introduce the concept of kernel development and the Zig programming language.
2. Setting up the environment: Install Zig 0.10.1 and set up the necessary development tools.
3. Writing the code: Explain the provided code and its components, including the VGA text mode color constants and the terminal struct.
4. Building the kernel: Compile the code using Zig and generate the kernel image.
5. Testing the kernel: Run the kernel in an appropriate environment or emulator to observe the output.
6. Customization: Encourage participants to modify the message or explore the VGA text mode color scheme to create their own personalized kernel.
7. Show and Tell: Each participant can present their kernel and discuss the modifications they made.
8. Q&A and Discussion: Address any questions or concerns and have a group discussion about the learnings and challenges faced.

**Now let's answer the questions about this Jam idea:**

- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 

Participants will have the freedom to customize the message displayed by the kernel or modify the VGA text mode color scheme. By allowing personalization, each participant can create a unique visual style or add their own touch to the project, giving them a sense of ownership over their kernel.

- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?

This project provides an opportunity to dive into kernel development using the Zig programming language. Hack Clubbers can learn low-level programming concepts, explore hardware interaction, and gain insights into operating system fundamentals. Understanding kernel development is crucial for advanced programming and system-level understanding.

- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam:

1. Introduction: Present the project idea and explain the importance of kernel development and the Zig programming language.
2. Setup: Help participants install Zig 0.10.1 and set up their development environment.
3. Guided Coding: Walkthrough the provided code, explaining the VGA text mode color constants and the terminal struct.
4. Building and Testing: Assist participants in compiling the code using Zig and running the kernel image in an appropriate environment or emulator.
5. Customization: Encourage participants to modify the message or explore the VGA text mode color scheme to create their personalized kernel.
6. Show and Tell: Each participant can present their kernel and discuss the modifications they made.
7. Q&A and Discussion: Address any questions or concerns and have a group discussion about the learnings and challenges faced.

- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)

Club members will gain knowledge about kernel development, and the Zig programming language. They will understand the basics of VGA text mode, hardware color constants, and how to interact with low-level system components. Participants will have their own personalized kernel that they can further modify and explore.

- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?

This workshop offers an exciting opportunity to explore low-level programming, kernel development, and interact with hardware. Participants can see their custom message displayed in VGA text mode and experiment with different color schemes on a completely new operating system, fostering creativity and engagement. It provides a hands-on experience in a unique domain of programming.

- What platforms will be supported (i.e., MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?

The project can be completed on platforms that support the Zig programming language. This includes platforms such as MacOS, Windows, Linux, and others where Zig is compatible. This project was tested to work fully on Linux and Windows.

- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?

Club leaders can be provided with a template or structure for the Jam presentation. They can customize the content, add their own project details, and integrate it into the overall Jam presentation. This allows them to take ownership of the meeting and tailor it to their club's interests and goals.
