# Godot Games, Create your virtual gaming world (https://godotengine.org/)
### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your own customized game in GoDot with a unique gameplay experience and visual style
_Requirements:_ GoDot engine,  windows/MacOS, creativity, Web (HTML5) and imagination
_Language used:_ GDSCript, C# and C++

_Customization opportunity:_ create a game with your vision by customizing gameplay mechanics, sound, and visual effects. 

_Platform Limitations:_ none
_Time estimation: based on the complexity of the game

### Breakdown
- Set up: create a new Godot project and define our game concept. 
- Part 1: design the visual assets, including characters, environments, and objects. We can use built-in tools in Godot to create or import 2D or 3D assets based on our game's requirements.
- Part 2:  Write scripts in GDScript or other supported languages to bring our game to life and define player controls, implement game rules, handle collisions, and create interactive elements based on your unique gameplay concept.
- Part 3: Using Godot's audio capabilities to create immersive soundscapes that match the mood and tone of our games.
- Success!!!! Now we have created a customized game in Godot that reflects our creativity

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answers these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
   
 By creating their game projects, hack clubbers can unleash their creativity
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
 
 Ans- They can learn valuable skills in game design, programming, and project management while having fun and expressing themselves through interactive experiences. Developing games can also foster problem-solving skills, teamwork, and self-expression.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)

Club members will gain a foundational understanding of game development principles, including game design, scripting, asset integration, and user interface implementation. They will also learn how to use the Godot engine effectively Also GDScript  is a high-level, dynamically-typed scripting language specifically designed for game development within the Godot game engine
- What makes this workshop fun or exciting for Club Members?
 
 The workshop offers a hands-on approach, where Club Members actively participate in the game development using the Godot engine. They get to experiment with different features, code their own game logic, and see immediate results as their creations come to life on the screen. This interactive experience fosters a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?

Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?

Club leaders will be able to showcase their game development projects created in Godot during the Jam presentation. They can share their experiences, challenges, and successes with the rest of the group, providing inspiration and guidance. This will give them a sense of ownership over the meeting and allow them to contribute their expertise and insights to the workshop.
