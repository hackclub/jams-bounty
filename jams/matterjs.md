# Matter.js - Creating cool stuff with the power of physics

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create simple and realistic animations or enviroments using matter.js
*For this jam i will be making an angry birds clone as an example while explaining all the core features of the library*
<!-- undecied (yet) -->

_Requirements:_ Replit

_Language used:_ html and javascript (objects, classes, etc) (optionally css)

_Customization opportunity:_ Custom shapes and bodies with various adjustable properties (friction, momentum, etc). Jammers can create their own simlations and possibly games using knowledge from the jam

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms (+ App available on both iOS and Android)

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
1) project overview, Brief introducion to ``<canvas>`` element and matter.js (5 min)
2) engine and rendering setup (10 min)
3) Introduction to "bodies" and their types (static, composite, etc) and making the test level (10 min)
4) Constraints and making bodies interactive (15 min)
5) styling with css and images, responsive layouts (10 min)
6) DEMO / working with external renderers[optional] (10 min)


**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
  - Challenges will be sprinkled throughout the jam  ranging from small tweaks to fundamental changes
  - a variety of project ideas will be given during the initial slide so jammers can detach from the idea entirely
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
  - Why just look at the [homepage](https://brm.io/matter-js/) :0. 
  - Hack clubbers by the end of the jam will be able to use real life physics with their animations and web pages using the library adding a new level of complexity and awesomeness.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
  - Clubbers will walk away with a portfolio worhty project and solid understanding of 2d physics engines, which can be applied further such as games, animations, etc
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
  - In my opinion The hint of reality and gravity in their projects will lead to a lot of fun ideas and demos during vlub meets which will surely make them amazed
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
  - all platforms are supported due to it being browser-based (via replit)
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
  - Workshop: 50 min
  - Demos: 5/10 min
<!--  How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)? -->
