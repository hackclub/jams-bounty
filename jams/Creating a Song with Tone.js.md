# Let's build a game!!

This Jam involves members utilizing Tone.js and the Replit coding environment to compose their own unique songs, which they then will be able to change the tempo and pitch of.

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Members will have a better understanding of music production through coding and will have created their own original melody using Tone.js.

_Requirements:_ Access to Replit.

_Language used:_ JavaScript(Tone.js library)

_Customization opportunity:_ Participants will have the opportunity to express themselves by composing their own unique songs. They can experiment with different instruments, rhythms, and melodies to create a song. They will also get to choose at what tempo and pitch they prefer their melody in.

_Platform Limitations:_ No limitations as long as members have access to a replit.

_Time estimation:_ 1 hour

### Breakdown
1. 5 minutes: Introduction to Tone.js and its capabilities in music production.
2. 10 minutes: Setting up a Replit project with Tone.js library included.
3. 10 minutes: Understanding the basics of music synthesis, including instruments, oscillators, and filters by showing a variety of sounds able to be generated by tone.js. Additionally, understanding how combining these different sounds into certain patterns can create a melody.
4. 10 minutes: Adding beats and rhythms using Tone.js's drum machine or sampler.
5. 5 minutes: Manipulating and modulating sounds with different effects.
6. 10 minutes Fine-tuning the song and making sure that tempo and pitch can be altered when running the file.
7. 5 minutes: Changing the background color each time a new note is played.
8. 5 minutes: Sharing the created songs within the Jam session.

### Questions
#### How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
This Jam will show how to make a song using tone.js but the members will get to actually make their own melody.

#### Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
1) The Jam will teach members how to use javascript and Tone.js
2) The Jam will teach members the structure of music
3) The Jam will show members how music can be combined with coding. 

#### What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
1) Members will have a better understanding of Javascript.
2) Members will know how to use tone.js
3) Members will have their own song made in replit.
#### What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
Not many people have heard of making songs with coding, having the opportunity to do so can be an interesting experience to them. Additionally combining their melodies into a symphony will encourage group participation.
#### What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
Any device with access to replit.
#### How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
Instead of using our example for a song, the Leaders could put in their own example and then they could show the steps they took to make the song.
