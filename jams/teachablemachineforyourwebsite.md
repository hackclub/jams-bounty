# Fine Tuning your own Machine Learning Model for your first website using Teachable Machine

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your own fine-tuned Machine Learning Model using audio, video, or poses to create Machine Learning functionality on even static websites. **(Beginner Friendly - Good First Workshop)**

_Requirements:_ Replit Access, Google's Teachable Machine, Camera or Microphone

_Language used:_ Javascript, HTML.

_Customization opportunity:_ Fine-tune your model to recognize any type of sound, video, or pose, embedded it into your own website of your creation, and write javascript that interacts with the predication values from your model, to do anything from turning your voice into a piano to creating a who do you look like website.

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms (+ App available on both iOS and Android)

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Fork a replit starter with necessary materials + Sign into Teachable Machine using a Google Account(Recommended) (5 minutes)
- Part 1: Choose a model option on teachable machine and navigate to the training page after coming up with an idea on what you want to train the model on. (5 minutes)
- Part 2: Get data for your model under the different classifications you are trying to identify and upload the files or collect them via webcam or microphone.(10 minutes)
- Part 3: Select the training parameters in the advanced section, train the model, test it using google's preview, and retrain as necessary adjusting data and parameters till it is working reliably. (10 minutes)
- Part 4: Export the model and copy the code snippet for Javascript to use in your website(5 minutes)
- Part 5: Adding the model to your website's script.js file(5 minutes)
- Part 6: Customizing past the model(using the documentation along with workshop guide, edit the javascript snippet, or rewrite it, in order to achieve additional functionality past being informative, the snippet's default function) and styling with CSS to make it fit with the site style.(20 minutes)
- You now have a working machine learning model inside your website that can identify whatever you trained it on along with being able to interact with your other code.

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
	- Everyone is inputting their own data, even if they aren't able within the time frame to edit the java script to change the way the model displays or interacts with the rest of the site, everyone's model will perform a different function since they will be using all different sources of data.
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
	-  It's a great way to have fun for beginners without too much struggle, integrate something interactive into their websites at any level, and can lead the way for javascript and machine learning learning which can be built upon teachable machine which makes it easier to start.
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
	-  5 Minutes setting up Replit and Teachable Machine.
	- 5 Minutes choosing a model and an idea for classification.
	- 10 Minutes to collect data and classify it in preparation for model training.
	- 10 Minutes to export model and import it into your website using javascript.
	- 20 Minutes to customize and write javascript that interacts with the predictions from the model.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
	-  They will learn about the fundamental idea of Machine Learning and integrating an API into your website.
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
	-  You can utilize data that is personal and can be absolutely hilarious. From your favorite characters, to the most meme able sound clips, to pictures of your friends, it's all on the table.
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
	-  Teachable Machine along with replit are web based and available on essential all platforms. 
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
	-  Club Leaders can create their own snippets that perform a function, create a website to place all of the workshop resulting projects, create their own model trained to perform a function, or even build an example project simultaneously while teaching.

### Challenges and Extensions
- Previously mentioned, the Javascript Snippet, writing your own javascript, styling with CSS are all options for furthering your teachable machine project.
- There are options to use P5.js in order to turn your model into a part of a game.
- There are options for using the model in microcontrollers for a hardware project.
- There are options to use it in other non-web based forms like in Tensorflow with Python.
- At the end, it's just a tensorflow model which means it can do basically anything that any machine learning model can and as a result, there are limitless possibilities, challenges and extensions.
