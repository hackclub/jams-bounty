# Zero To Crypto Hero: Learn how to make your own secret notes

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Creating a web page that will allow a person to encrypt & decrypt messages using a simple cipher (caesar for the purposes of the jam), acting as a primer to cryptography & encryption

_Requirements:_ Repl.it access 

_Language used:_ HTML, JavaScript

_Customization opportunity:_ Allow Jammers to use an existing cipher, or make their own (encouraging development of their own alogrithm).Jammers may also opt to include a native sharing option (via bluetooth? a backend server?)

_Platform Limitations:_ None (browser-based repl.it jam)

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Preamble: What is encryption? Where do we see it? How is it different that hashing?
- Set up: Use the HTML repl.it starter OR a custom github starter repo (I will create, contains solely some bare-bones html structure & a js file)
- Part 1: Create the necessary html UI (2 inputs & 2 buttons "encrypt"/"decrypt")
- Part 2: Implement the Caesar cipher in JS
- Part 3: Implement the actual encryption/decryption operation, showing the results on the page
- Congrats! You have made your first secret note maker!

- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? - See customization opportunities. The implemented algorithm is intentionally simple, as to encourage jammers to seek out more secure ciphers and implement them themselves
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project? - This relates to teenagers' personal experiences (lack of privacy from parents, teachers) and is interded to, in a joking way, rebel against it, by passing around messages only those that know can read. Also, technical teenagers are increasingly privacy-minded, and this can be a jump-start to a deep dive in encryption & security
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam:
  - Preamble is being presented by the leader while setup is being done
  - Setup is complete; now everyone works towards creating the HTML UI (can be customized as tey wish), only maing sure everyone uses the same element IDs (to simplify debugging)
  - JS is written according to the workshop, now everyone should have a working caesar machine!
  - Students get matched in teams, use a shared secret (the shift used for the cipher) and throw notes around, trying to share secrets only amongst them
  - Really quick recap of the preamble, suggestions for customization are provided
  - Meet done, now go get the pizzas!
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product) - A surface preview fo the world of cryptography and a working encryptor/decryptor for text messages
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)? - All (browser development)
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)? - At the end, we can include other successful or innnovative algorithms created by clus around the world
