Summary: Members will utilize Python and ASCII values to build a generator that transforms string characters into customized emojis and symbols.

Outcome: Members will have a personalized encrypted language of visual symbols. Through this project, they will enhance their comprehension of ASCII values, while loops, and string character analysis.

Requirements: Access to Replit.

Language used: Python

Customization opportunity: At its core, users will have the freedom to select symbols that represent individual characters, allowing for personalization. For those seeking a greater challenge, members can opt for symbols that represent a combination of characters or even entire words.

Platform Limitations: No limitations as long as members have access to a replit.

Time estimation: 1 hour or less

Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
Members will learn about the structure of ASCII characters and develop the skills to analyze lengthy string characters commonly used in competitive programming.

What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
Being in a group setting members will get to share their encryptions with one another and they would also have the opportunity to try and decrypt the messages.

What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
Any device that has access to Replit.

How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
Club leaders have the flexibility to select the theme upon which members will base their encryptions(i.e. Only Red Symbols, Only Scary Emojis, etc).

General outline: 
1)Members will learn about ASCII characters and their significance in coding. 
2)Members will gain familiarity with the process of printing symbols(e.g. emojis) in Replit. 
3)Members will learn the fundamental concept of converting ASCII values to corresponding symbols. 
4)Members will get to share their projects and have the opportunity to utilize the remaining time to embark on individual visions.
