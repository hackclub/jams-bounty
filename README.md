# Jams 🫐🍓🍇
Teaching coding is hard. Running engaging Hack Club meetings is even harder. That's why, this summer, we want to create an all-new repository of the most incredible coding projects ever! 

**☀️ This summer join us to build the future of Hack Club workshops - we're calling them Jams!**

We want to work with you to create an epic Jam, and **we'll pay you $200** for your 10-15 hour time commitment. And, your Jam will be used by thousands of Hack Clubbers around the world!

### 👀 What is a Jam?

A Jam is a real and fun project that can be completed in under 1 hour. It is very visual, has clear paths for continued hacking, and everyone's end result is different. It encourages real learning, not just copying and pasting! The goal is to build a quality project for varying technical abilities and will include slides and a video alongside a text description.

### ✅ Here's how to get started:
*NOTE: We're only accepting 20 Jams in this round*
1. Propose a Jam by making a pull request
  - Fork this Repo
  - Open [the jams folder](/jams) and create a new markdown file answering questions in this [example](/jams/example.md)
  - Name the file with the name of your project and make a pull request

1. Hear back from the team within 48 hours Mon-Fri on whether your proposal is accepted.
1. Once accepted, work closely with the team to write the Jam, make a presentation and film a short video by July 19.
1. Ka-ching💰🪙!

### 🌈 Submission requirements:
- We cannot offer the bounty to individuals in India. Hack Club Bank, our payment method, is virtually impossible to use in India. You're welcome to particpate, but you will not qualify for $200.
- You must be a club leader or an active community member in order to submit a Jam.
- No two Hack Clubbers should have the same result (neither technically nor visually) after going through the Jam.
- Jams should come with a document (providing steps for creating the project), a presentation (intended for use within clubs), and a video (intended for Club Leaders to send to their Club Members if they miss a meeting).
- Your Jam must propose a compelling, specific, real project, using real code. **It should not be a tutorial** for a language or service. It should also not be a series of small projects with no clear ending or final product.
  - ✅ [Animated 3D Models](https://workshops.hackclub.com/3d_models_with_zdog/), which uses a simple JavaScript library to create awesome-looking 3D models
  - ❌ A tutorial for how to get started with AWS
  - ❌ A workshop on an introduction to Scratch
- Your Jam must involve code, and not require desktop software or hardware, since not all clubs will have those resources.
  - ✅ A Python workshop where the first step is to start a new Python project at [repl.it/languages/python](https://repl.it/languages/python)
  - ❌ A workshop on making an Android app that requires installing Android Studio

**Nice-to-have:**
-  Browser-based Jams are strongly preferred because they are by nature cross-platform (working for Chromebooks, Macs, Linux Devices, and Windows Computers). 
   - They also typically have short setup times, making it easy for leaders to get their members started building their project.
   - This isn’t a requirement, but a strong suggestion (especially for beginner workshops). We do understand that this isn’t always possible.*
- Challenges should be sprinkled throughout the Jam (with solutions in dropdowns).
- Jams should take no longer than one hour to complete (if you want to build something larger, consider separating it into smaller separate parts).
- Include memes, jokes, and a generally humorous style throughout the Jam.
- Include resources for Hack Clubbers to learn more about the topic you’re introducing them to.
- A low floor and a high ceiling.
  - Allow Hack Clubbers, both experts and beginners, to challenge themselves and learn. This can be achieved by giving Jammers creative freedom in your Jam.

**Super-optional but magical ✨:**
- A poster for club leaders to use to promote the Jam in their school.
- Leader Notes to brief a leader on using the meet in their club.
- Fun interactive elements where Hack Clubbers work together in their club meets


### 🌱 What now?

We're so excited for the future of Jams and if you have a great idea, make a PR and propose it! We want to work closely with you to turn it into high quality content that clubs and individuals will use every day.

If you have any questions, please message in [#jams](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058T2CJUNR) on Slack. We'll all be hanging out there to help out.
